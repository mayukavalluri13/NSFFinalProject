	Air Pollution is when the air is contaminated by chemicals and gases. This problem is mainly caused by factories and vehicles. When factories and vehicles release gas, this affects the environment by suspending in the air.For example, in China the air pollution is so bad that the some people say that you can literally see the pollution in the air.
<br/> 
<br/> 
There a couple of ways to solve this problem. First, we can reduce the amount of gas the factories release. We can also limit the amount of times we use cars to not release as much gas. By putting these two ideas together we can reduce air pollution and maybe even eliminate it from certain areas.
