	Water Pollution is when water is polluted because of the chemicals and waste released into the water. This can cause many aquatic animals to die because their habitat is destroyed. This pollution is usually caused by factories or trash on the road. This is a serious problem because not only is the water contaminated toward fishes, but the water we drink will be contaminated as well. Since humans will die after three days without water, water is a vital part for us. 
<br/> 
<br/> 
As all pollution, there is a way to stop it. Water pollution can be stopped by reducing the amount of chemicals we release by factories and vehicles. Another way that we can stop water pollution is by reducing the amount of trash we let lay around in the street.
