	Light Pollution is pollution that is caused by overuse of light. Although many people think that this type of pollution is not very serious, but that is not true. Most people know that you cannot see stars during the night in the city, but do you know why? The reason is light pollution. In the city, there are many offices and apartments that give out a lot of lights. This is because many people use different computer screens and many lights. This causes problems to the enviornment and to many animals. As to all pollution there are ways to stop this problem.
<br/> 
<br/> 
A way to stop this problem is to use less light and control the amount of time we use electronics. This will reduce the amount of light pollution in the area. If one day we reduce light pollution to such an extent, then maybe we may be able to see the stars in one of the biggest cities.
