	Land Pollution is when the land of a certain area is polluted. This can happen when trash is accumulated in a certain area. This is due to people throwing their trash on the road and when somebody sees trash, but does not pick it up. This causes problems for humans and animals because their homes and environment is becoming a landfill. 
<br/> 
<br/>
There is a way to solve this problem. A simple way would be to not throw trash on the road. Also, if there is trash found on the road, people should pick up it up because it could end up causing land pollution. Every little piece of trash could make a difference.
